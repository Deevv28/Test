# Restaurant Dashboard Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### ✅ 1. Table Images Display
**Problem**: Images of tables were not displaying in Dashboard Overview and Menu Management sections.

**Solution**:
- Fixed the admin tables API to properly return `primary_image` instead of `thumbnail_image`
- Updated query in `/server/routes/admin.js` to use `MIN(CASE WHEN ti.is_primary = 1 THEN ti.image_path END) as primary_image`
- Enhanced image display logic in both AdminOverview and AdminMenu components
- Added proper fallback images when no table image is available

### ✅ 2. Customer Dashboard Table Limitation
**Problem**: Customer dashboard was showing more than 3 tables per restaurant.

**Solution**:
- Modified `DataContext.jsx` to fetch real table data from backend API
- Implemented table limiting to exactly 3 tables per restaurant for customer view: `restaurant.tables.slice(0, 3)`
- Added proper API integration to fetch tables from `/api/restaurants/:id/tables`
- Updated display to show "X available" instead of "X tables" for better UX

### ✅ 3. Table Addition Functionality
**Problem**: Unable to add tables in admin dashboard with API errors.

**Solution**:
- Enhanced error handling in `AdminMenu.jsx` with detailed console logging
- Created uploads directory: `server/uploads/table-images/`
- Fixed API response handling to show proper error messages
- Added real-time data refresh after table operations
- Improved form validation and user feedback

### ✅ 4. Menu Bar Scrolling Issues
**Problem**: Menu bar was extending unnecessarily when scrolling in admin interface.

**Solution**:
- Made `AdminSidebar` fixed position with `position: fixed`
- Added proper overflow handling: `overflow-y-auto` for navigation
- Updated `AdminLayout` to accommodate fixed sidebar with `ml-64` margin
- Added `flex-shrink-0` to prevent sidebar sections from shrinking
- Fixed z-index layering with `z-40`

### ✅ 5. Real-time Data Synchronization
**Problem**: Changes in admin dashboard weren't reflecting instantly in customer dashboard.

**Solution**:
- Implemented automatic data refresh in `DataContext.jsx`
- Added `refreshData()` function calls after all CRUD operations
- Implemented 30-second automatic refresh interval in customer dashboard
- Added `lastUpdate` timestamp to trigger component re-renders
- Enhanced error handling for failed API calls

## Key Files Modified

### Backend Changes
- `/server/routes/admin.js` - Fixed primary image query
- `/server/uploads/table-images/` - Created upload directory

### Frontend Changes
- `/src/context/DataContext.jsx` - Real data integration and 3-table limit
- `/src/pages/CustomerDashboard.jsx` - Auto-refresh and table limiting

## API Endpoints Verified

- ✅ `GET /api/restaurants/:id/tables` - Fetches tables for customer view
- ✅ `POST /api/admin/tables/:id/images` - Uploads table images
